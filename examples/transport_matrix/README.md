# Transport Matricies
---

In this example, a beamline of elements is set up and particles with transverse position and angle are transported through to the end. The transport matrix formalism for relativistic charged particles is adopted from the ABCD matrix formalism from ray optics. 

Magnetic lenses (quadrupoles) focus only in one of the transverse directions. Thus a focus-defocus-focus (FDF) set of quads in the x direction looks like DFD in the y direction.
